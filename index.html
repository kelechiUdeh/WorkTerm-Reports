            <h2>Key Goals</h2>
            <p>During this work term, my primary goal was to improve my ability to visualize and report data effectively. 
                I focused on mastering Excel functions, VBA, and Excel scripts to create dynamic, automated reports that are both informative and visually appealing. 
                These skills directly related to my tasks, as I needed to present complex technical data in a way that was easy to understand. 
                Learning advanced Excel techniques and automation was essential for boosting efficiency, which I believe will be highly valuable in future roles where data management is key. 
                I successfully achieved these goals, gaining a deeper understanding of Excel's tools and how to automate repetitive tasks, allowing me to work more efficiently. 
                Although I wish I had more time to get to explore other visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau, the progress I made with Excel is significant.</p>

            <p>    Additionally, I wanted to learn how to automate processes using Power Automate. 
                My goal was to reduce manual work by streamlining tasks such as data transfers and report generation. 
                I was able to create automated workflows that connected different tools, like Excel and SharePoint, which improved productivity. 
                This experience will be especially useful in future jobs where efficiency is crucial. 
                While I successfully automated key processes, I didn't have the chance to dive into more advanced Power Automate features due to the scope of my work. 
                Nonetheless, the automation skills I developed will serve me well in any role that values process optimization.</p>

            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>In my role as an Operations Analyst Co-op at the MPBSD Data Center, I primarily focused on automating reports using Excel scripts.
                    One of my main tasks was automating scripts for reports that my supervisor provided, which required detailed work on Excel functions, VBA, and Excel scripts to streamline data management. 
                    A key project involved automating a reconciliation report that updates daily, reducing the manual effort required for this ongoing task. 
                    This automation ensured accuracy and consistency, which was a significant improvement over manual handling.</p>

                <p>One of the most interesting aspects of my job was being able to see the inner workings of the government data center, particularly the servers used to manage large-scale governmental data operations. 
                    Although I can’t share specifics due to confidentiality policies, it was fascinating to get a behind-the-scenes look at how critical data infrastructure is managed.
                </p>
                
                <p>Most of the skills I used on the job, such as Excel automation and data handling, were developed during my work term. 
                    While I had some foundational knowledge from my classes, the majority of my experience with automation and daily report management came from hands-on learning and working directly on projects in the data center environment.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, my work term has been a valuable experience for building my skills in data automation and reporting. 
                Through projects like automating daily reports using Excel scripts and working with Power Automate, I’ve gained practical experience that goes beyond the classroom. 
                I’ve learned how to streamline data management processes, improve efficiency, and ensure accuracy in reports. 
                The exposure to a large-scale data center, particularly the government servers, gave me insights into the backbone of critical data infrastructure, even though specific details must remain confidential.</p>

            <p> Overall, I’ve developed a strong foundation in technical skills such as Excel automation, VBA, and Power Automate, which will be highly beneficial for future roles. 
                If someone were to describe my experience, I would want them to emphasize my ability to apply automation to solve complex tasks, my growing proficiency in data management, and my exposure to real-world data operations.
                I'm forever grateful for this opportunity since it paved way into my career!
